# Binary and Splay Trees

This repo contains code that emulates the behaviour of binary and splay trees. There are two mains included in this repo. The first one is the actual main and the second one was used when testing the program. The Timer.cpp and Timer.h files were provided to my class at the start of the assignment and I did not write them. They are used to judge the efficiency of the program.
